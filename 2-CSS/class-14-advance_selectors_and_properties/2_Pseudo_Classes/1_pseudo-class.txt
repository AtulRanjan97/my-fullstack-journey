CSS Pseudo-Classes (Source ChatGpt)
A pseudo-class in CSS is a keyword added to selectors that defines the special state of an element. It allows you to style elements dynamically based on their state, position, or user interaction without needing to modify the HTML.


Syntax:
    (css code)
    selector:pseudo-class {
        property: value;
    }
